#Windows

Windows is clearly the best platform for developers.  Ok, we just said that to make you feel better.  Prepare for some mocking from your Mac & Linux counterparts, but while they're spending hours typing obscure commands in their terminal you can gloat at how you can run programs that actually make life easier.  That being said, a lot of developers do use Windows as their development environment.  There's a reason Windows is installed on more computers than anything else.

If you want the full "command line" experiance, you can always install Ubuntu on a Virtual Machine.
