# Linux (Ubuntu)

Linux is clearly the best platform for developers.  If you get a job writing python code, there's a high 
likelyhood that your code (when released) will need to run a linux server.  So why not have your 
production and development environments run the same OS?  Just makes sense, huh?

Even if your computer is running OSX or Windows, you can easily install Ubuntu as a Virtual Machine to play around with it.
